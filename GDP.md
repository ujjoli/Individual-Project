This plot shows 50 states GDP showing North Dakota being has highest chagne of GDP from 2009 to 2019. This tells us that compared to other states North Dakota's GDP has increased more than any other states. Now let's look a closer look to see, which states make top 20 in the list in bar plot.

The bar plot indicates the same thing where North Dakota is the top state and is followed by Washington, Texas, Utah and California. 

Here, GDP of the state is the sum of total contribution in that state from different areas or industries. Deeping into, lets just compare the GDP in 2019 and see which state is top growing state just in 2019.

So, from the table it becomes clear that California is in top of the table, being followed by Texas, New York and Florida. Now, we know that California is at top state with highest GDP, let's see which industries in California are contributing to its GDP.

From this dought-not shaped pie-chart , we can see that to rank California as the top state in GDP, Real state, rental and leasing is contributing significantly more than any other industries. 40% of its GDP is coming from real estate, leasing and industry. This is significantly huge !!. This indicates that businesses related to real estate might be sky rocketing and there might be a good chance that many people are employed in this area in California. 

Now let's move to our [second part of analysis](Income.md)
